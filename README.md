See doc.go.

This is a fork of the goplay code inculded in misc/goplay of the go1.2 release.

It's a proof of concept to show how you can include runnable examples for your own
packages on your own webserver

To run the default server but point to a different server for doing the compilation do:

```bash
go run goplay.go -compile <url>
```
